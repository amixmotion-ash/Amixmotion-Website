                <p class="bio">After 14 years as a creative in digital design, I discovered my passion for visual storytelling while traveling through Asia. Now based in London — and always happy to travel — I specialise in videography and editing that blends design sensibility with cinematic technique. From creative concepts and shot planning to dynamic cinematography and polished edits, I craft engaging narratives that bring brands, events, and ideas to life through compelling visual content.</p>
